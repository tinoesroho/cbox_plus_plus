# About Cbox++
Cbox++ was born out of sleep deprivation. The example img bbcode in the filter inspired me to go beyond the bounds of cbox.ws and write my own code. This caused a week-long descent into madness, over the span of two years, culminating in this easy-to-install code.

I have included three flavors here. For Cbox Premium activated before 2015 or for current Cbox Pro, please use Cbox++. For current cbox Premium, please use Cbox++ Lite. For free cboxes, please use Cbox++ Pico.
